                  <ol>
                    <li>TripzyGo International LLP is neither a carrier nor a provider of accommodations.</li>
                    <li>Each journey (whether undertaken or not) that the Client booked by land, sea or air is governed by the conditions of the carrier undertaking to provide that carriage. Some of these conditions limit or exclude liability and are often the subject of international agreements.</li>
                    <li>Copies of the applicable agreements are available for inspection at the offices of the carrier concerned.</li>
                    <li>It is the Client’s responsibility to re-confirm the onward or return sectors of any air journey with the carrier concerned and according to such carrier’s terms and conditions and respective regulations.</li>
                    <li>When a Client books accommodations (whether provided or not), its availability or provision is subject to the ‘house rules’ of the hotel or other accommodation providing or undertaking to provide such accommodations.</li>

                  </ol>
                  <h4 className="border-b mb-2 pb-1">Termination</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>We reserve the right in our absolute discretion to terminate the client’s travel arrangements without notice should the said client’s behaviour be such that it is likely in our opinion, in violation of any applicable governing laws, causes distress, damage, annoyance, or danger to TripzyGo International LLP, or any of its staff , fellow travellers or any other person. In such circumstances, no refund or compensation will be due to the client.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4 className="border-b mb-2 pb-1">Hotel Check-In And Check-Out</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Clients should be guided by the Hotel’s Check-in and Check-out policies. Each hotel varies in their check-in and check-out time. However, the standard hotel check-in is at 2:00 PM while check-out is at 12:00 PM (Noon). Early Check-in is SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY and Hotel Surcharge.</li>
                    <li>Damage and Loss of Hotel Key Cards, Bed sheets and Towels, and Consumption of Food and Drinks in the Mini-fridge-Bar and other Incidental Expenses  are NOT included in the Tour/Travel Package and these are charged to the Client.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4 className="border-b mb-2 pb-1">13. Tour Guides</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Clients should take note that Tour Guides and Tour Facilitators are NOT the personal maids of the guests/clients. A tour guide (U.S.) or a tourist guide (European) guides visitors in the language of their choice, provides assistance, information and cultural, historical and contemporary heritage interpretation to people on organised tours and individual clients at educational establishments, religious and historical sites, museums, and at venues of other significant interest. As such, Clients should not expect that the tour guides would personally assist to their every need.</li>
                    <li>Carrying of Luggages is the responsibility of the clients.</li>
                    <li>During meals, the tour guides will sit at the table next to the clients. If clients do not wish to sit beside the tour guide, please advise in advance so that we could make proper arrangements.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, a tour guide is also a human person who deserves some respect. Thus, we advise our clients to treat our tour guides with proper respect and decency. If clients need to reprimand the tour guide, please do so in a decent manner, otherwise, we would be constrained to cancel your tour without any refund.</li>
                    <li>Screaming at or insulting tour guides/drivers or fellow passengers or third party businesses and subcontractors is NOT ACCEPTABLE under any circumstances and will terminate and cancel your tour without any refund. Discrimination against a customer or a tour guide/driver for any reason is not acceptable either under any circumstance.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4 className="border-b mb-2 pb-1">14. Insurance</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Please note that individual travel insurance is not included in the tour price and all medical costs and other costs involved must be paid for by the client. It is therefore strongly recommended that participants take out personal travel insurance, especially for the active tours.</li>
                    <li>We strongly recommend to all of our clients to purchase comprehensive travel insurance prior to departure to meet any contingencies that would cover against cancellation charges, unexpected curtailment of your vacation, medical expenses arising overseas including repatriation, loss or damage to luggage and personal liability claims against you. Should you fail to secure such Travel Insurance coverage prior to your travel, then you accept full responsibility for yourself and all of the members of your party, and indemnify TripzyGo International LLP and our overseas Travel agents and representatives (as applicable) for any and all costs that may arise, which would otherwise have been met, had such travel insurance been in force.</li>
                  </ol>
